# Restaurant Page
Restaurant page project from The Odin Project Curriculum. 

[Live Demo](https://weizhixie.github.io/restaurant-page/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **npm** v5.2.0 or higher
- **Node.js** v8.2.0 or higher  

First install all required packages with:
```
npm install
```

Build the app in production mode to bundle the source files into the dist directory. This process optimizes and minifies the files for the best performance, making them ready for deployment:
```
npm run build
```

Alternatively, you can run the app in development mode. In this mode, pages reload automatically when you make changes, and errors are displayed as they occur:
```
npm run start
```
